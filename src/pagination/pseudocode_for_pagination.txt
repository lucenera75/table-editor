pseudocode for pagination:
everytime there is an edit wait for 1 second and run the repaginate function, (debounce it appropriately, if necessary)

the repaginate function will
declare an array of pageClasses = ["portrait-content", "landscape-content"]
those are pages

iterate over pages and get all direct childrens that are statically positioned, if any of the children is not fully visible cut that element and all the following elements
    check if the next page has the same classeName, if it does add the elements as first children
    otherwise create another page with the same className and put the elements there
