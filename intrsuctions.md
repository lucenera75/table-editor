intrsuctions:

in this directory create an html page with a table

I need you to create a js file that allow to edit the table. 
add remove rows and column, merge and split them
format a cell, a row or a column with alignement, font size, background-color, etc
I also want to be able to split the table at specific row, and repeat the headers if necessary
